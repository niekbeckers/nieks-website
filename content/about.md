Hi!

I am an engineer and researcher interested in human-robot interaction. I enjoy understanding the complex interactions between humans and robots, making computational models of human behavior, and developing robots that can work in synergy _with_ humans. This requires a multidisciplinary toolkit, which I try to apply and strengthen every day, ranging from robotics and machine learning to human factors research. To support my research I built my own robots and software (check out my [projects]({{< ref "/projects" >}})). I love working with people and stepping out of my own 'knowledge comfort zone'.   

I am a postdoctoral fellow at [Cognitive Robotics](https://www.tudelft.nl/3me/over/afdelingen/cognitive-robotics-cor) and [AITech](https://www.tudelft.nl/aitech) of Delft University of Technology working on human robot interaction. Among others, I work with colleagues from many disciplines, from computer science to industrial engineering and philosophy to better understand how to design AI and robots that remain under human control. Application areas include automated vehicles and robots that work with humans in industry settings. I did research in rehabilitation robotics, and even investigate how we, humans, adapt to space üöÄ. Always looking for a new challenge!

Besides tinkering with my own robotics projects, I love the winter :snowflake: and I am an avid mountain enthusiast ‚õ∞Ô∏è.
