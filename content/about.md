Hi!

I am an engineer and researcher interested in human-robot interaction. I enjoy understanding the complex interactions between humans and robots, making computational models of human behavior, and developing robots that can work in synergy _with_ humans. This requires a multidisciplinary toolkit, which I try to apply and strengthen every day, ranging from robotics and machine learning to human factors research. To support my research I built my own robots and software (check out my [projects]({{< ref "/projects" >}})). I love working with people and stepping out of my own 'knowledge comfort zone'.   

I am a postdoctoral researcher and human-robot systems engineer at [Cognitive Robotics](https://www.tudelft.nl/3me/over/afdelingen/cognitive-robotics-cor) and [AITech](https://www.tudelft.nl/aitech) of Delft University of Technology working on human robot interaction. Among others, I work with colleagues from many disciplines, from computer science to industrial engineering and philosophy to better understand how to design AI and robots that remain under human control. I am driving to develop state-of-the-art technology to create better human-robot teams. Application areas include automated vehicles and robots that work with humans in industry settings. I did research in rehabilitation robotics, robots that can augment human capabilities and learning, human-centered automated driving technology, and even investigate how we, humans, adapt to space üöÄ. Always looking for a new challenge!

Besides tinkering with my own robotics projects, I am an avid mountain enthusiast (climbing, mountainbiking, hiking, ...) ‚õ∞Ô∏è, and winter is my favorite season.

You can find my resume [here](/resume-nwmbeckers-220421-online.pdf). If you would like to get in touch, please send me a message on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/niekbeckers/).

Thank you!
